## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate developer with a strong foundation in both **low-level programming (C)** and **web development**. I study at **1337 (42 Network)**, where I’ve worked on real-world algorithmic challenges, system-level projects, and full web stacks using PHP and JavaScript. I enjoy solving complex problems, building clean architectures (MVC), and constantly learning new technologies.
